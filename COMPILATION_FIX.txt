// Test compilation fix
// AuthResponse is now generic with Object data field
// This should resolve the BatchController compilation errors

Fixed Issues:
1. AuthResponse.data is now Object type (was UserDto)
2. Backward compatibility maintained with getUser() method
3. BatchController can now pass BatchDto, List<BatchDto>, and Map objects

The compilation errors should be resolved:
- Line 25: List<BatchDto> -> Object ✓
- Line 39: BatchDto -> Object ✓  
- Line 91: BatchDto -> Object ✓
- Line 102: Map -> Object ✓

Backend should now compile successfully.
